HexCoding ruby c extension
==========================

HexCoding is a ruby c extension that should be approximately twice as fast as the
normal to_hex in ruby. It uses a simple lookup table for converting strings to 
hex strings and vice versa. 

Detecting Integer types is not support but can trivially be added(it wasn't necessary 
at the time).

Requirements
============

obviously you need gcc and the usual stuff.

Installation
============

ruby extconf.rb
make
